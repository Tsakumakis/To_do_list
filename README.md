# To_do_list
(not finished)
This is my first ever project that i made for myself, its really half baked but im proud of what it has become.

# Setup


## How to use

The app could be confusing but really its not that difficult to use. You press the add button then a pop up window appears where you insert your activity and the date.
Afterwards you can view the tasks on the main window
There is a delete button next to the activity where if you press the button you can delete the activity
The refresh button is there just in case something does not work correctly
(soon)The save button where you can export your file and have it on other devices as well.
